# Python Data Structures
## About
In this project, I implement common data structures in python
## Goal
I did this project with the goal of learning to implement common data structures in
python.
## Requirements
- Use Python 3.x.x+

## Tests
"Code without tests is broken as designed", said  [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://jacobian.org/writing/django-apps-with-buildout/#s-create-a-test-wrapper). Therefore i shall not give you code that
can not be tested or has no tests. So, to run tests, enter the following command
```sh 
    $ python python -m unittest
```
## Running the examples
Each data structure has a problem it solves and these are in the root directory as examples.
### stack
The `stack` data structure is used to solve the problem of a `postfix` calculator. To run the `postfix` calculator
enter this command;
```sh 
    $ python -m unittest postfix_calculator
```
